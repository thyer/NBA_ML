<p>You've landed on the project page for NBA Machine Learning. Our repository contains code and some data which has been used to analyze how professional basketball behavior changes over time. Our main efforts have been in studying (1) the effects of long playing time on shot accuracy and (2) the proliferation of three-point shooting over the seasons 2011-2016. Please feel free to use our code and data within the limitations provided by the license agreement. For up-to-date statistics and data, we recommend you visit probasketballapi.com, which was the main source for our analysis. </p>

<p>NBA_ML started as a class project for a machine learning course at Brigham Young University. The first project was focused on LeBron James' 2011 comments that his coach was playing him and his teammates too long (turns out his coach was playing him just the right amount of time) and the second project investigated a spike in three-point shooting following the 2011-2012 NBA season (still no solid conclusion as to why, possibly the Steph Curry effect). </p>

<p>NBA_ML has no current project and therefore nobody running it. However, <a href="https://github.com/thyer" class="user-mention">@thyer</a> is hosting the repository and will happily respond to any inquiries concerning research results or future studies. </p>
